## 1. Concept Implementation Elegance and Fluency (2.5 pts)

### Current Status: Targeting Full Marks (2.5 pts)
- [x] **Core Concept Realization**: Time flow elegantly expressed through ink diffusion
- [x] **Seamless Flow**: Natural transition between second/minute/hour drops with 1:6:36 size ratio
- [x] **Coherent Elements**: All visual components (ink drops, fluid simulation, stains) work together harmoniously
- [x] **Ephemeral Effect**: Perfectly captures the "fleeting moment" concept with coffee-like residue

### Implementation Details
- **Time-based Drop Generation**: Every second creates a new drop, every minute creates larger drops, every hour creates massive drops
- **Size Hierarchy**: Second drops (small), Minute drops (6x larger), Hour drops (36x larger)
- **Color Progression**: 60-step gradient from Blue→Yellow→Red representing minutes
- **Stain Residue**: Drops leave subtle traces instead of disappearing completely

### Areas for Excellence
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Ensure 60fps with multiple active drops
- [ ] **Visual Polish**: Refine stain fade timing and opacity curves
- [ ] **Conceptual Depth**: Ensure the ephemeral nature is immediately understandable
