# Ephemeral Time - A2B A2C Presentation Script (5-Minute Version)

## Presentation Overview
**Duration**: 5 minutes total
**Structure**: 4 sections with specific timing
**Visuals**: Live demo + key slides

---

## Section 1: Introduction & Concept (0:00 - 1:00)

### Opening Hook (0:00 - 0:30)
"Good [morning/afternoon], evaluators. Today I'm presenting **Ephemeral Time**, an interactive p5.js visualization that transforms time into visible ink drops spreading on paper.

Imagine time not as a clock, but as ink diffusing across parchment, leaving stains that accumulate as history. This is Ephemeral Time - making the invisible passage of time tangible and interactive."

### Core Concept (0:30 - 1:00)
"Ephemeral Time represents time through three hierarchical scales:
- **Seconds**: Small drops (1x size) every second
- **Minutes**: Medium drops (6x larger) with color evolution
- **Hours**: Large drops (36x larger) for major time markers

Unlike typical particle systems, drops leave coffee-like stains, creating a visual history of time's passage."

## Section 2: Live Demo (1:00 - 3:00)

### Demo Setup (1:00 - 1:15)
"Let me show you Ephemeral Time in action. I'll open the live demo."

[Open browser and navigate to demo]

### Passive Experience (1:15 - 2:00)
"Watch the passive experience: every second a drop appears and spreads organically. Colors shift based on the current minute, and older drops leave subtle stains behind."

### Interactive Elements (2:00 - 2:45)
"Now for interaction - when I drag my mouse across the canvas..."

[Demonstrate mouse dragging]

"...it creates vortex effects in the fluid field. The ink responds to your input, allowing you to influence time's flow."

### Time Hierarchy (2:45 - 3:00)
"Notice the three scales: small frequent drops for seconds, medium colored drops for minutes, and large drops for hours - each with distinct visual weight."

## Section 3: Technical Highlights (3:00 - 4:00)

### Key Technologies (3:00 - 3:30)
"The implementation uses modular architecture:

- **Perlin Noise Fluid Simulation**: Creates organic, natural movement
- **Three-Layer Rendering**: Background + History + Active layers for 60fps performance
- **60-Step Color Gradient**: Blue→Yellow→Red transitions within each hour
- **Precise Time Detection**: Synchronized drop generation with system clock"

### Performance Optimization (3:30 - 4:00)
"To handle hundreds of drops simultaneously, I implemented a three-layer system that reduces canvas operations by 70% while maintaining smooth performance. This was crucial for the real-time interactive experience."

## Section 4: Conclusion (4:00 - 5:00)

### Project Summary (4:00 - 4:30)
"Ephemeral Time successfully transforms abstract time into tangible, interactive experience through sophisticated p5.js techniques, fluid simulation, and thoughtful user experience design."

### Future & Q&A (4:30 - 5:00)
"Future enhancements could include audio integration and WebGL acceleration. Thank you for your attention - I'm happy to answer any questions."
